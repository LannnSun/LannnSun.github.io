<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a third-year PhD student in the MSP Lab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), supervised by Professor Ling Pei. I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the School of Instrument Science and Engineering (ISE) at Southeast University in 2023. My research interests include human motion semantic understanding based on wearable devices, large language models, and inertial positioning.
